<h1>Bucket List Journey</h1>
<h2>My traveling stories</h2>

<p>
   
   Ever since I got to The Netherlands I have been traveling to new places. Traveling around the world has been my dream since I was a little kid. 
   I love to see a new culture, meet new people, and being a big foodie I'm always fond of trying new dishes. 
   My very first traveling was to Seychelles, an East African Island. It's such a beautiful and dreamy place to visit. Quite expensive though.
   I spent two weeks there. I visited the island La Digue, Mahe, Prsline, and Anse Source d'Argent.

    My first visit to Paris was in 2018 February. It was very chilled and snowy weather.
	Few European cities are very famous in India for Bollywood movies. Paris is one of them. That's why I think Indians have a dream to visit Paris. 
    Paris is very famous for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture. The city itself is beautiful. There is a lot of things to visit. So at first, 
	I decided to visit a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world The Eiffel Tower. Then I went to the Louvre Museum, 
	It's the world's second-largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, France, and is best known for being the home of the Mona Lisa. A central landmark of the city.
    Followed by The Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, Notre-Dame and few more. 
    The currency in Paris is the euro. The language is French. I also bought a few gifts and souvenirs from "Parisi, Memories of Paris", which costs between €20 to €60.

	I visited London, the capital of the UK in 2019 August. It's a beautiful place to visit. Being an English-speaking country, it is a lot easier to interact with people and very comfortable.
	Also, I found a lot of Indian restaurants there. Overall the food was amazing. In London, I visited The British Museum, Natural History Museum, Tower Of London, The National Gallery,
	London Eye, Tower Bridge, etc. The currency in London is the pound. I bought a few souvenirs and gifts from "To The Home From London".  They cost between  £10 to  £50.
